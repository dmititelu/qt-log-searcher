# HR-941412 Coding Assessment

Hi,

We are happy that you are taking part in our technical assessment which is the initial part 
of the interview process for our open engineering positions.

As previously explained, you have a time frame of up to 24 hours to complete this test. The test
comprises two parts. Part one consists of some tasks that you can solve in a mock git repository
project. Part two consists of answering questions we have for you in written form.

On the day of your test we will make the assessment instructions and tasks available in this repository by 9AM (your time) for you to work on so make sure you use git to pull in the recent changes the day of your test.

Until then here is a little glimpse at what is part of the instructions, so you can prepare for the formalities:

## Instructions Part One

* Clone the repository we have sent you a separate invite to
* Create a branch to implement your changes on
* Choose a minimum of 2 tasks to work on, optionally you can choose to solve as many more as you want
* Once you are done, commit your code changes to the source repository
  * Tip: commit the changes to individual tasks seperately to make it easier to review for us, add clear commit messages
* Push your change to remote and create a pull request from your branch to master for us to review your changes. We will assess your results based on the pull request so don’t forget to create one!
  * See also: https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

## Instructions Part Two

* Please answer the questions in written form within a text file. Append that text file to an
email with the title: “HR-941412 Assessment, Answers Part Two” and send it back to us OR
* commit your answers within this repository by creating a text file with your answers called "HR-941412_Assessment_Answers_Part_Two.txt"

## Other notes

* the project is a Qt source project, it contains both Qt C++ code and QML markup
* the build system used is qmake

We wish you the best of success for the assessment!
